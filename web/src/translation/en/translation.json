    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "isThisTheMoneyButton": "Is this bot the ultimate 'Money' button?",
    "isThisTheMoneyButtonAnswer": "No! Our bot is a supportive tool that simplifies many routine tasks and saves your time. It is not a 'Money' button, and your participation in configuring various parameters is also required.",
    "howToConnect": "How to connect?",
    "howToConnectAnswer": "To connect to the bot, enter the /start command. Further instructions and actions will be described within the bot itself. Please read carefully what needs to be done.",
    "botTradingPrinciple": "What principle does the bot trade on?",
    "botTradingPrincipleAnswer": "Our bot trades by purchasing an asset for the USDT amount you specify, followed by placing a limit order at a price higher than the purchase price. On dips, the asset is bought in a 'ladder' fashion every n% drop. During a rise, the previously placed limit orders are executed, and the cycle closes, after which the bot automatically starts a new one.",
    "canBotDrainDeposit": "Can the bot drain the deposit?",
    "canBotDrainDepositAnswer": "No, the bot cannot drain the deposit. The most that can happen is transferring USDT to KAS due to incorrectly set parameters.",
    "useBotYourself": "Do you use this bot yourself?",
    "useBotYourselfAnswer": "Of course. Everyone involved in the creation of the bot actively uses it. The strategy was initially tested manually, then a bot was created to significantly ease and speed up this process. After that, a bot was developed for mass use.",
    "connectionCost": "How much does the connection cost?",
    "connectionCostAnswer": "The cost is 20 USDT for 30 days.",
    "canITradeManually": "Can I place an order for the entire deposit?",
    "canITradeManuallyAnswer": "You can, by configuring the parameters through the corresponding command. However, this increases your risks of freezing the entire USDT deposit in the asset and missing potential profits from further price movements. We recommend dividing the deposit into 20-30 parts.",
    "canICancelOrdersManually": "Can I also trade manually?",
    "canICancelOrdersManuallyAnswer": "Yes, you can manually trade using this strategy. However, you will have to regularly monitor the exchange rate, calculate percentage values, manually set them on the exchange, and immediately open new orders...",
    "whatIfICancelledOrderManually": "Can I cancel orders manually?",
    "whatIfICancelledOrderManuallyAnswer": "Yes, technically you can cancel orders. However, we strongly advise against doing this, as manually cancelling orders will fix your losses on them...",
    "cancelledOrderManuallyOnExchange": "What if I cancelled an order manually on the exchange?",
    "cancelledOrderManuallyOnExchangeAnswer": "If you cancel an order manually on the exchange, our system will process it automatically and remove the order from the bot.",
    "canIStoreAssetsInColdWallet": "Can I store my assets in a cold wallet?",
    "canIStoreAssetsInColdWalletAnswer": "Since the strategy implies regular transactions, assets (USDT and KAS) must be stored on the exchange on a spot account. We recommend initially setting the size of the deposit that you are ready to keep in circulation, and all that is on top to withdraw to your cold wallet.",
    "canYouMakeBotForFuturesTrading": "Can you make a bot for futures trading?",
    "canYouMakeBotForFuturesTradingAnswer": "Futures are evil :)",
    "canYouCreateBotForOtherCoins": "Can you create a bot for other coins?",
    "canYouCreateBotForOtherCoinsAnswer": "We can do this, but at the moment we do not see bullish assets other than KASPA. Therefore, we are not ready to connect other coins now.",
    "whyMEXC": "Why specifically MEXC?",
    "whyMEXCAnswer": "This exchange is the largest in terms of the KASPA market, it is convenient and, most importantly, there is no commission on the spot (at the moment). The exchange is time-tested and does not arouse suspicion.",
    "whyKASPA": "Why specifically KASPA?",
    "whyKASPAAnswer": "Kaspa is the only POW coin that has solved the cryptocurrency trilemma. We see a huge potential for further growth of the coin rate, up to $ 1. Thus, the only risk that may arise is to become a long-term investor of the Kaspa coin.",
    "canYouWithdrawMoneyFromMyExchangeAccount": "Can you withdraw money from my exchange account?",
    "canYouWithdrawMoneyFromMyExchangeAccountAnswer": "No, we do not have such a technical capability and we are not interested in it. And also on the exchange side, you regulate access to actions. There is no need to set the output option in the API keys settings.",
    "doYouGuaranteeProfitability": "Do you guarantee profitability?",
    "doYouGuaranteeProfitabilityAnswer": "Profitability is guaranteed in a growing market (if KASPA continues to grow). In case of drawdown, we recommend getting positions and waiting for orders to be executed",
    "whyThisStrategyIsBetter": "Why is this strategy better than 'Buy and Hold' or 'DCA'?",
    "whyThisStrategyIsBetterAnswer": "These strategies also imply a growing market. At the same time, our strategy allows you to earn not only on growth, but also on a fall, as well as on a flat (sideways) price movement.",
    "whereToAskQuestions": "Where can I ask questions about the bot?",
    "whereToAskQuestionsAnswer": "In our chat, you can get all the answers. You can call the chat administrators and ask them any questions you have."
